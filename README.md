#  To Do List

First day of Ruby on Rails Epicodus course. Partner and I were tasked with creating a simple to do list in rails.

## Usage

To run this project you must have rails installed.

Open project in terminal and run bundle to install necessary gems and run the following in terminal.

```
rake db:create
rake db:seed
rake db:migrate
rails s
```

You should then be able to open on localhost:3000. You can then add tasks you need completed and mark a task if it is completed.
